          <div class="panel-body">
            <p>My goal in life is to study software development and apply the in-depth knowledge of protein structure & function(as a biochemist) along with the development of software-based tools(as a software developer) to create innovative products (software/hardware) that aid in accurate modeling and prediction of protein function. More to that, experience in protein function, protein data analysis, and software development will help me support a variety of research and development projects related to public safety, defense and national security as my long term plan in the future. The latter is of great importance to me as a refugee, because maintaining safety and peace means first priority and being vulnerable to violence could be eternal scar to haunt you.</p>

      <h2>My projects</h2>
      <p>My projects are regarding the current profession I am pursuing, which is the web-development. I have listed some links below to help you navigate from there to get to know me more. Feel free to contact me via email <em><a href="#">semaria.eyzac@gmail.com</a></em> for questions or feedback. I also encourage you to make changes to my codes in Github if you see fit to update it or fix errors. Lets make our world a better place to live by sharing and helping each other out.</p>

        </ol>
      <h2>My Future goals</h2>
      <p>My goal in life is to study software development and apply the in-depth knowledge of protein structure & function(as a biochemist) along with the development of software-based tools(as a software developer) to create innovative products (software/hardware) that aid in accurate modeling and prediction of protein function. More to that, experience in protein function, protein data analysis, and software development will help me support a variety of research and development projects related to public safety, defense and national security as my long term plan in the future. The latter is of great importance to me as a refugee, because maintaining safety and peace means first priority and being vulnerable to violence could be eternal scar to haunt you.</p>
